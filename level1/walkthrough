The executable uses gets to receive user input

Gets does no bound checking, and is therefore very unsafe

Writing more than 75 character (76 counting the \0) segfaults

Using GDB we see that we are overwriting the return string

We also find a function called 'run' that executes /bin/sh

Taking all that into account, we use the gets overflow
	We write the address of 'run' (0x08048444) over the return address

echo -e "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\x44\x84\x04\x08" > /tmp/l1
cat /tmp/l1 | ./level1
